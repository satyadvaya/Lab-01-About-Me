                I'll have to admit I a little rusty when it comes to telling my horrid story, so how about I make a bunch of stuff up instead, hmmm?  Okay, let's see, I'm going to imagine that I was left on the doorstep of a wicked old witch at the tender young age of three.  That ought to be worth some sympathy points, no?

            <p>...</p>
            <p>
                No?  Wow, you're a tough audience.  Would it provoke a sympathetic response from you if I intimated that I've been dropped on my head on no less than thirty-four occasions?  Yes, it hurt every time!  No again?  You're a little grim yourself, aren't you?
            </p>

                Oops, I just check the layout of this hideous little self-indulgent biography and saw that it needs a skooch more breadth in order to successfully float past my revolting photo.  I suppose I could shrink that pic, but I'm too narcisistic to give that any serious attention as a potential resolution to my current layout woes.  I'd ask if you understand, but I'm too curmudgeounly to care about your opinion one way or another.  I guess I'll just get older and older, and nastier and nastier ... There!
